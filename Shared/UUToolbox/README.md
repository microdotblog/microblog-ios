Useful Utilities
========================
Useful Utilities is a toolbox of iOS functions and code that can be pulled in as needed for functions that 
you repeatedly find yourself doing in your code. 

The central design imperative is that there are no dependencies and that each pair of .h/.m files can simply be dropped into an existing project and be used with a minimal amount of code. 
They are intentionally lightweight and need to avoid the "kitchen sink" syndrome that happens to most libraries.
If you have something you'd like to contribute, let me know.  Sharing is fun!

The code is released with no strings attached. You don't even have to give me credit. Just enjoy using them. 
I use them almost every day and literally on every project I work on. Feel free to shoot me quesitons, thanks, complaints or suggestions.
I love hearing from people. If you end up shipping a product with any of them, I'd also love to hear about it but it's not required.
